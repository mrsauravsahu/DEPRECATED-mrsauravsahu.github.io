<p>
  Digital consultant and full stack engineer at Digital McKinsey. Fascinated
  about how things work. I really like learning algorithms and how they’re used
  to solve real world problems. I create web and mobile applications ready for
  use in our every-day lives. On the client side of things, I use React to
  create web applications; React Native and Xamarin.Forms to create mobile
  applications. On the server, I use ASP .NET Core and Node to create APIs.
  Learning is a constant here, and currently, I’m learning Svelte to increase my
  frontend skills and delving into Cloud with Microsoft Azure.
