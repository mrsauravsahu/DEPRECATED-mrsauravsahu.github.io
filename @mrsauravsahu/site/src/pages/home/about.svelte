      <p>
        Fascinated about how things work, learning algorithms and how theyâ€™re
        used to solve real world problems. I create web and mobile applications
        ready for use in our every-day lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the server side of things, I use ASP .NET Core and Node to create
        APIs. On the browser, it's mainly React to create web applications;
        React Native and Xamarin.Forms to create mobile applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning is a constant here, and currently, Iâ€™m learning Svelte to
        increase my frontend skills and delving into the Cloud with Microsoft
        Azure.
