It looks I haven't been posting for quite a few months now, I guess. I basically spend my time studying for my college. Lab exams will start in a few days and then followed by the written theory papers.

Other great things I've been doing...
-------------------------------------

From this point on, I am writing this article using the HTML viewer. It might not sound like much, but this is really cool. I started studying HTML, CSS and the quintessential JavaScript. I found out how powerful they are. I frequently visit [Channel9](https://channel9.msdn.com/) and look for stuff, and I found this HTML5 and CSS3 series by [Bob Tabor](https://twitter.com/bobtabor). I have always loved his work and this series was also great. I still have to look up tags that I don't remember and I feel being a newbie, that is fine.

Thinking about Hybrid applications
----------------------------------

I have been hearing about Hybrid applications using JavaScript a lot lately, and as I have started with JavaScript, I will make sure that I get all of this under my belts as quickly as possible.
