That routing post kind of became long, so I don't feel like posting it now. So, switching gears here.  
  
  
Life is boring, really. Doing the same thing everyday. Get ready for college, study, come back home and sleep. Not to mention the huge number of assignments they give.  
  
  
Supposedly, some people don't like it that I'm always sad. Well, that's how I am, at first. Talk to me more often and you'll realize. I don't know if YOU will read this, but if you do, you'll understand what it's about. I always wonder how drastically life is going to change after three years. To be honest, I'm scared. Being a student is so easy. Just follow the teacher's instructions. But yes, at any point of time, you need someone by your side. Even their presence is enough.  
  
  
I haven't done much in that TOR project. I'll get back to it as soon as these things about life stop giving me the creeps.  
  
  
Later.
