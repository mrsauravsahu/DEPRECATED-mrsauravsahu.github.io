Not sure where I'd heard this, but it goes like something like...

> "Our dreams reveal our deepest desires."

I have been thinking about it for quite a while now.  Interpreting what my dreams meant is something I have done for a long time. But unlike few, I don't discuss it with others. Living in different parts of the country whilst I was young, means I have memories of places that I don't quite remember vividly, and thus when I see these places in my dreams, it often freaks me out. These places might not mean much to me now, but they must be important when I was a child and that's probably a reason I see the same places again and again popping up. I cannot tell you how deeply our choices are affected by our dreams, at least at a subconscious level. Also, there are people in your life you don't talk to that often, but they turn out to be your best friends in your dream. And then there are those who you talk to everyday, or have a **liking** towards and they turn out to be complete strangers. It's like _Mal_ from _Inception_, it's not even funny. As a child I was a big fan of Lucid dreaming and it did take me some time getting used to it. Not sure what the right formula is, but I did manage to get some cool superpowers, to say the least. 😆 But too much of anything isn't always good. Change is probably the most difficult thing in the world. I have wondered and wondered about what my dreams meant and made rash decisions based off of them, but this has reduced to a great extent these days. I would love to change this but change is in short supply.

  I have reached a one year mark on my first job. 😬 (counting the Internship together 😅) It would be unfair to say that I don't miss college days. Looking back, it does seem that I could've enjoyed more, but there's no point in pondering over it. Work life is great, let's see how it goes.
