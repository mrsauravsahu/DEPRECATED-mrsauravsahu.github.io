Just realized I've created new problems that didn't even exist while trying to simplifying things. Case in point, CI for a monorepo. The [portfolio](https://github.com/mrsauravsahu/mrsauravsahu.github.io) repository uses a mono-repo. Before that, it was just a front end component kit and a static site with sapper. But now that I have the monorepo setup (a new blogs repo) how do I manage the deployment process? I don't want to deploy to Github Pages just because I added a new API in my blogs project. Maybe I need to check in my CI process which projects' files got changed and trigger a corresponding CD? But that's just too much, right?

After looking around for a while, turns out that's one of the ways you'd do things. But if I were using something like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes for container-based deployments, this problem would still be there. Maybe this would be an optimization, but atleast new images would still built for each of the services, right?

Need to research on this more.
