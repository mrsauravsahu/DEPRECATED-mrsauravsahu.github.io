Okay, so, it's been a while since I've posted anything. Basically, I've been using Ubuntu as my daily driver and for the most part, it's good. Now, I'm working on TOR, "The Onion Routing", about which you can read here: [www.torproject.org/](https://www.torproject.org/)  
  
Mainly, what we're trying to do, is to change the parameters that TOR uses and check how it affects the output, that is, mainly, the speed. And we don't want to use the actual TOR network. So, we're using simulators like [Shadow](http://shadow.github.io/) and [Stem](https://stem.torproject.org/). And honestly, I don't know much programming. So, I'll appreciate it if you have some suggestions, like, tutorials and all, related to TOR.  
  
Nowadays, I'm learning basic Ubuntu commands and reading Shadow documentation.  
  
P.S. I still use Windows
