It's a good time to start from the basics again, I suppose.  So, yeah, first year of engineering has almost come to an end. Speaking of engineering, there are some subjects that are just plain boring and some that you hate for weird reasons. But subjects like math and physics are interesting as well as important for future.

Let us talk about the things that we should definitely keep in mind when there's an exam coming. Firstly, yes, you need a time table. I have made this mistake before and I repeat it every time. I always think about making a time table to plan out the timings, syllabus and most importantly whether you have the studying material for that topic. Second of all, study for less amount of time, maybe, but have concentration. Rather than  studying the entire night, just study for a few hours and take some rest. Lastly, don't just study for the sake of writing the exam, but to learn some facts. I am no master and I don't follow these strictly, but these would definitely be key to reduce stress during exam times.  
  
Let us change the topic of discussion a little bit. Everybody sees the world differently, but being a Computer Science student, I see it as a place where software is very important. Software is not just a bunch of lines of code that make a hardware "run", but they've become so much more than that. It's fascinating, really. When software is discussed, operating systems are never neglected. Often, OSs are compared to each other without really thinking about the purpose for what they've been created.  
  
**Windows.**  
  
Why Windows?  
I always talk about Windows, but there are only a few times have I compared it with other competing operating systems. This is because all of them are created for different purposes. My dad bought a desktop when I was in my seventh grade. Up until then, I had only used computers at school, which is quite rare and only for short periods of time. I was really good at computers, really. I had no idea how to use them. It was in my tenth grade that I seriously considered Computers as a subject of study, and I'm really happy that I did. I had been studying about different types of OSs, programming languages, the basic stuff and it was after my twelfth class that I really looked into what they really mean. We all know that in school, we give importance only to theory.  
  
After all this, I started studying Java and C# in my holidays after the twelfth class. We get around 3 months holidays after the Class XII exam. For some reason, I didn't like Java. I have no idea why.  
I was browsing the InterWebs when I came across [Channel9](https://channel9.msdn.com/) Website, maybe I was watching some conference maybe. Then I found out about courses available there. I guess the reason I like Windows for what it is, is because of Bob Tabor. He is the one who really made be interested in developing for Windows (still learning, though).  
  
I have no problem in using any other operating system unless it is difficult to use. I have grown familiarity towards using Windows and I think I'm going to stick with it. I still might study about others in a theoretical manner.  
  
So, yes, I had installed Windows 10 Insider Preview and had run into some problems where my desktop was pretty much busted. I had to reinstall the Preview and I have updated to Build 10159. It clearly looks like it is very near to the RTM release and you should get a sense of how it will perform and feel. In a single line, it is the best version of Windows, yet.  
  
Later.
