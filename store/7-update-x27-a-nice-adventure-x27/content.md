Regarding the TOR project, I've set up the simulator - Shadow. The only thing that is stopping me right now is the fact that I don't know how to edit the simulation environment to get the desired results. So, I'm learning basic HTML and XML.  
  
  
From the next post I'll talk less about OSs and we'll go towards Networking.  
Peace.
