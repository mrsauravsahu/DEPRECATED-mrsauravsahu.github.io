VSauce is one of the best Channels that I'm subscribed to.  
Some other recommended channels would be DetroitBorg, TheAverageConsumer, Rosanna Pansino, VSauce2, VSauce3, MinutePhysics, REACT, MinuteEarth, ASAPScience.  
I love all these channels and make sure that I don't miss any of their videos. Sorry, if I missed any.  
  
  
Also, I have my internal examinations coming up so most probably I won't be blogging, but who knows, I might.  
  
  
Have a nice day.
