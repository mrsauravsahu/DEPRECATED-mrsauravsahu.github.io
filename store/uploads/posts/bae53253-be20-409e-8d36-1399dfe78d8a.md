At first, I was a little skeptical whether I'll be creating a blog or not. But it seems that keeping a record of what you're doing is a good idea. So, recently I installed Ubuntu and am using it as my primary OS. I installed it alongside Windows 8.1. After 4 days with Ubuntu, I have mixed feelings about it, really. The best part about Ubuntu is the font. I know it sounds crazy, but that's the truth. I really like the font. I hope I'll get used to the OS pretty soon. 

But, I miss Windows very much. For far too long, I've been using Windows, and I think saying Goodbye is hard. I think I'll stop talking about Windows here, because if I start, it'll be difficult to give a rest. Let's keep it for the future.  
  
Here's a screenshot :P

The following is basically a log of what I've been doing since the last 4 days. 

  

*   01.22.2015
    
*   Installed Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
    
*   Checked Facebook
    

  

*   01.23.2015
    
*   Installed Google Chrome
    
*   Installed VLC
    
*   Read about Swap Space - [https://www.linux.com/news/software/applications/8208-all-about-linux-swap-space](https://www.linux.com/news/software/applications/8208-all-about-linux-swap-space)
    
*   Read a little bit about Shadow Simulator [https://shadow.github.io/](https://shadow.github.io/)
    
*   ENCOUNTERED errors rergarding partitions mounting. Solved by turning off 'Fast Boot' in Windows. Windows saves the state of the files while shutdown into _hiberfil.sys_  so that computer resumes quickly, but others can't access the drives and changes can cause problems.
