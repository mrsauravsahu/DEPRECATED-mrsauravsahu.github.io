In the upcoming days, I'm planning on moving the Blog toÂ a different service, without any reasonable explanation. WordPress would be it, I suppose. I have read articles where the state of the blog is preserved when moving it and I would definitely make sure that it is.

Daily work right now is to understand how TOR works and other "secret" projects. Mainly, studying language constructs and algorithms.
