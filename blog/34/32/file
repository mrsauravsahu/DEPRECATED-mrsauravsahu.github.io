  

In the World of technology, nobody is a winner. All the tech giants make our lives better, in one way or the other. But each one of us, have a personal favorite. The reason for that might not be the same. Some are like, "everyone uses bla-bla-bla, so I'm also gonna go with that." Others like to stand out from the crowd so, they get something else. Or they just like the functionality it provides. But the point is that no matter what you're using, it shouldn't get in your way, in your daily life. I use my PC, laptop, phone all the time. But that doesn't mean that I'm a nerd or whatever. 

  

Technology was something that was supposed to keep us together, but I don't really see it that way. It's going in the opposite direction, isn't it? But why am I talking about all this? Because I've seen how technology tears apart friendships. But, there's nothing much we can do about it. What I'm trying to say is that we shouldn't let these things get in our way. We should just use the gadgets available today to make our friends and family closer. That's it. 

  

BTW, in my last post, I'd said that we're gonna use Stem as a simulator for the TOR project. Actually, Stem is a python library controller for TOR. My bad. We are using Shadow. 

Let's talk about the project a little bit. Currently, I'm just copying and pasting commands into the terminal. But I'm starting to understand some of the commands. Being a freshman, I have no knowledge of Ubuntu at all. So, that is why I'm reading books and keeping the use of other OSs to the minimum. Ubuntu is really interesting. I could really help some suggestions from you, regarding books, other blogs, anything. 

  

I really get angry when people taunt me about my tech choices.

Let's see how things change in the coming days, hopefully. ;)
