Uh, if you really think about it, everything in life boils down to a very basic inescapable fact. That being, not everyone knows everything. This not only relates to knowledge, but is tied to each and every aspect of our lives - our view of how others are living their lives, others' opinions and so on.

It is difficult to accept this fact and frankly I'm not going to, either. But it took quite a while to realise this, and I'm grateful to the one who made me understand how my behaviour was like, all this time I'd spent with that person.

Why is this suddenly popping in my mind? I've got too much time to kill.

I screwed up.
