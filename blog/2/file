Windows is one of the best operating systems out there, seriously. At least from a customer's perspective. But now I realize the fact that, as a developer, you need to use an OS which is made for developers.  

So, yes, I've installed Ubuntu, and have been using it for quite a while now. It's pretty good. Here's a little pie chart showing the time taken for the installation. A total of 20-30 minutes for the actual installation, BTW. Creating back up is really important.

  

Here are a few important links:

Yeah, so, what have I been doing since the last 10 days? 

Basically, I've been watching movies and looking for replacement applications to use on Ubuntu.

  

Also, I'm starting out with a Project on [TOR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_%28anonymity_network%29). And to make things easy, I'm going to use [Shadow Simulator](http://shadow.github.io/).

NOTE: I still use Windows, once in a while ;)
