  
It's 1608 and the twentieth of June, 2015. I just remembered that I haven't written anything from quite a while. I have my external exams coming up and I've realized, that, for the first time, I don't have any difficult subjects. But they are certainly NOT interesting and that is why I'm putting a little extra effort. Also, I started watching videos from this Channel by \[Sir\] [Rhett](http://twitter.com/rhettmc)Â and [Link](https://twitter.com/linklamont). Their show "[Good Mythical Morning](http://youtube.com/rhettandlink2)" is really entertaining.  
  
I had started writing this post on June 17 because I'm having problems fixing my Desktop right now. The OS is not loading up. After the test, which ends around the first week of July, I will try and compete the 'Routing' post and will review certain things that I was working on. Yes, Windows is not loading up. It's the Insider Preview that is causing this problem.  
  
Will be back on July 2.
